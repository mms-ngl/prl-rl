> White circle is an UAV; red cells are trees on fire; green cells are either normal trees or foamed (extinguished) trees; gray cells are burned out trees with no possibility to be recovered. The goal of the UAV is to extinguish as much trees on fire as it can. UAV learns to detect fire by reinforcement learning method.
